S3 is a Global Storage Platform - regional based/resilient. 
 - provides a near infinite scalabe object storage platform and is accessible from anywhere with a public internet connection
 - tends to be the default storage location for data ingestion and output for many AWS services
 - unlimited data and multi-user 
 e.g. movies, audio, photos, text, large data sets etc. 
 
 Access: 
 via UI/CLI/API/HTTP 
 
 2 Main Deliveries: 
 - objects 
 - buckets
 
 # Objects 
 - made up of two main files: object key, value (data or content of object)
 - value of an object can range from 0 bytes to 5TB. 
 - they also have a version ID, metadata, access control and subresources
 
 # Buckets
 - data inside the bucket has a primary home region, and it never leaves the region unless the SAA conifgures it to leave
 - blast radius of failure is isolated to that region
 - identified by its name (e.g. caviedata) 
 - bucket names are globally unique 
 - bucket can hold from 0 - unlimited bytes of data; infinitely scalable 
 - no complex structure; completely flat
 - everything is stored in the bucket at the root level 
 
 Organizationally, naming files following the format: 
 /puppy/cavalier1.jpg
 /puppy/cavalier2.jpg
 /puppy/cavalier3.jpg
 
 will result in the bucket creating a file named "Puppy" and inside one can find individual files named: 
 cavalier1.jpg 
 cavalier2.jpg
 cavalier3.jpg
 
 These folders are referred to prefixes to object names. 
 
 # Exam Powerup
 - bucket names are globally unique 
 - bucket names must be 3-63 characters, all lower case, no underscores
 - can't be IP formatted 
 - limit of 100 buckets in an AWS account (soft limit) up to 1000 buckets (hard limit)
 - you can divide a single bucket using prefixes to create folders inside of buckets to almost "subdivide" them for an account with thousands of users 
 - S3 is an object storage system NOT an file or block storage
 - you CAN'T mount an S3 bucket as (K:\ or /images
 - great for large scale data storage, distribution or upload
 - great for offload
 - input and or output to many AWS products
