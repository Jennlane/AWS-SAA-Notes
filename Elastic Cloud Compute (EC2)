# EC2 

This is the default compute service within AWS. 
EC2 provides access to virtual machines (instances). 

# Important features: 
EC2 is IAAS. 
  -Because it is IAAS, its unit of consumption is an instance. 
Runs in the private AWS zone. 
Configured to launch into a single VPC subnet. 
Any public access has to be conifgured by the SAA, because it's by default private.
EC2 is AZ resilient. 
Different instance sizes and capabilities. 

# What do you manage of EC2? 
Operating system and upwards on the infrastructure stack 

# What does AWS manage of EC2? 
Virtualization
Physical hardware
Networking
Storage 
Facilities

# Billing features
On demand billing either by the second or the hour depending on the software launched with the instance
Only pay for what's consumed 

Breakdown of charges: 
-charge for running the instance (CPU and memory) 
-charge for storage (even if the instance is stopped) 
-extras for any commercial software that the instance is launched with

#Storage features: 
-on the local host 
-EBS (Elastic Block Store); network storage made available to the instance

# States of instances: 
- running 
- stopped 
- terminated 

Others include: stopping, shutting down and pending 

# Relationships between states: 
- once launched the instance moves into a running state
- can be moved from running to stopped if the instance is shut down 
- can be moved from stopped to running if its restarted 
- can be terminated; this is a one way change and cannot be reversed! 

# AMI (Amazon Machine Image) 
- can be used to create an EC2 instance 
- can be created from an EC2 instance 
- supplied by AWS 

This is similar to a server image which can be used to create virtual machines. 
It contains: 
- attached permissions (what can use the AMI) 
- owner of the AMI is implicitly allowed to create EC2 instances from the AMI
- add explicit permissions (specific AWS accounts allowed use or set to public)
- boot volume of the instance (drive the boots the operating system)
- block device mapping (links the volume the AMI has and how they are presented to the operating system)

# Last bit of theory 
EC2 isntances can run different operating systems 
- a version of Linnux 
- a version of Windows 
3389 is the Remote Desktop Protocol used for Windows instances 
22 is the port for SSH protocol for Linnux

From Linnux Shell or Windows Command Prompt: 
- you pick a key pair to use either by creating one or using an old one 
- creates two parts of the same key: 
  - private key; download and keep the private copy safe (how you authenticate to the instance) 
  - public key; AWS keeps and places on an instance
